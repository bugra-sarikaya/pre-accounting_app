Instead of calling click event handler method of return button, its returning code was implemented in receipt submit button class.
To access last value of a column, "LAST" SQL function was learned in Stack Overflow [1] but it did not work.
"LAST_VALUE" function which is an alternative for "LAST" function, was found in an online document of Microsoft [2] and its usages were examined on 2 sources which are a document of Oracle [3] and SQL Server Tutorial [4].
"LAST_VALUE" function worked in SQL command of retrieving last value of "code" column in "orders" table and for accessing a cell value of result table, a solution was examined on Stack Overflow [5].
"product" column of "orders" table, was renamed as "id_product" and "code" column was renamed as "id_2".
"Identity Increment" feature of "id" column in "users" table, was set to "Yes".
"cost" column was added to "orders" table.
Insertion SQL command of "orders" table was written.
While testing, an SQL exception occured with "System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: 'Column name or number of supplied values does not match table definition.'" text and to solve this, a missing comma was added into SQL command.
Insertion SQL commands of "customers" and "addresses" tables, were written successfully.
Accidentally, a bookmark symbol was put on a code line in Visual Studio and to remove it, "CTRL + K + K" shortcut which was found in Stack Overflow [6], was used.
Insertion SQL command of "payments" table, was written successfully.
After examining figures in 2 webpages [7] [8] of Stack Overflow, "order_items" table was created and all colums, except primary column, of "order" table was moved to "order_items" table.
"id_" expressions were added to names of foreign key columns in "receipts" table.
Relationship diagram was edited by setting "id" column of "orders" table as a foreign key reference of "order_items" table and "id" column of "products" table as a foreign key reference of "order_items" table.
A different method for inserting a row to a table which has only one column, could not be found.
"IDENT_CURRENT" function which was found in Stack Overflow [9], returned an unexptected value for last value of primary key column in an empty table.
"MAX" function which was found in Stack Overflow [10], was used to obtain last "id" value of "orders" table but it returned an empty value because this table was empty.
Previous empty value was examined and "System.DBNull" expression was noticed on Visual Studio.
Result table was checked with "DBNull.Value" value which was found in Stack Overflow [11].
"id_customer", "id_address", and "id_payment" columns were moved to "orders" table from "receipts" table because SQL commands could not be implemented without turning off auto increment feature of "order" table.
Realionship diagram was updated by changing foreign key references.
SQL command examples on W3Schools [12], were examined to use "INSERT INTO" and "SELECT" keywords in one SQL command but they did not be useful for adding values from multiple tables.
Another approach for previous issue, was found in Stack Overflow [13], and it worked.
"DateTime.Now" was found in a video tutorial [14] on YouTube and it was used insert time value "date" column of "receipts" table.
Some found SQL methods were removed after updating tables but program new written SQL commands, added data into tables successfully.
