Last empty row of DataGridView, was removed by assigning "false" value to AllowUserToAddRows property which was found in ASPsnippets [1].
It was decided to minmize using double quotation marks for class or member names because it was noticed that Microsoft had not used them in their online documentation.
To access cell height of DataGridView, RowTemplate property was learned in Stack Overflow [2] and its Height member was used to narrow DataGridView size.
NumericUpDown class which was learned in documentation of Microsoft, was created for specifying product count.
Another add button was created to add product to product list on receipt.
Some codes from internet, were tested for copying data tables but they gave System.InvalidOperationException error which is about no columns.
To solve no columns error, columns were added by benefiting a code from Yazılım Bilişim [3].
An adding row method, which is intalling a temp row, was found Stack Overflow [4] and it was used.
A simple search method was written to increase product count instead of adding new row of same product.
Method of creating a DataGridViewTextBoxCell object, which was found in Stack Overflow [5], was used to add cells to a DataGridViewCell object.
While trying to use type conversion for cell, System.InvalidCastException error occured and to solve, this Convert.ToSingle method, which was found in a forum webpage [6] of Microsoft, was used.
For solving another type conversion error, Convert.ToInt32 method which was found in Stack Overflow [7], was used to convert decimal value of NumericUpDown to int value.
Form height was increased.
A TextBox was added to product panel to show total cost.
Structure of product TabPage was completed but visual design was not completed.
